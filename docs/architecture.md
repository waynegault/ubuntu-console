# Architecture & Developer Guide

## 5. Developer Guide — How the Profile Works

### Modular Architecture

The profile is split into a thin loader (`tactical-console.bashrc`, ~233 lines)
and 26 numbered profile modules under `scripts/`. Each module has a metadata block
documenting its dependencies and exports:

```bash
# @modular-section: <name>
# @depends: <comma-separated section names>
# @exports: <public functions/variables>
# AI INSTRUCTION: On ANY change to this file, increment the Module Version below.
```

The loader iterates an **explicit array** of expected module names (not a glob),
guaranteeing load order and preventing accidental sourcing of utility scripts:

```bash
_tac_expected_modules=(01-constants 02-error-handling 03-design-tokens 04-aliases
    05-ui-engine 06-hooks 07-telemetry 08-maintenance
    09-openclaw 09a-oc-gateway 09b-gog 09c-oc-core 09d-oc-agents 09e-oc-health 09f-oc-misc
    10-deployment
    11a-llm-registry 11b-llm-autotune 11c-llm-server 11d-llm-gpu 11e-llm-model 11f-llm-runtime
    12-dashboard-help 13-init 14-wsl-extras 15-model-recommender)

for _tac_mod in "${_tac_expected_modules[@]}"; do
    _tac_f="$_tac_module_dir/${_tac_mod}.sh"
    [[ -f "$_tac_f" ]] && source "$_tac_f"
done
unset _tac_mod _tac_expected_modules
```

Numeric prefixes enforce the dependency chain — `01-constants.sh` loads first,
`15-model-recommender.sh` loads last. Utility scripts live in `tools/` and
`scripts/` (see tables below), are not profile modules, and are never sourced
by either loader.

> rollback.

**Profile modules** (sourced in order by the loader):

| `tools/mirror-vault.sh` | Sync Obsidian vault from WSL to Windows. |
| `tools/run-tests.sh` | Pretty-printed BATS test runner. |

### Repository Boundaries

This repository intentionally excludes investigator/pipeline implementation code.
If feedback references symbols like `pipeline/model_benchmark.py`,
`BenchmarkCase`, `BenchmarkResult`, or `_normalize_confidence_label`, treat that
as out-of-scope for this repo unless those files are explicitly introduced.

Use `tools/check-repo-boundaries.sh` to enforce this contract. The check scans
`scripts/`, `tools/`, `bin/`, and `tests/` for forbidden cross-repo symbols and
fails fast when boundaries are violated.

```

### Naming Conventions

| Pattern | Meaning | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `__double_underscore` | Internal/private helper | `__test_port`, `__get_host_metrics`, `__strip_ansi` |
| `kebab-case` | User-facing command | `oc-health`, `get-ip`, `oc-backup` |
| Lowercase abbreviation | Tactical shortcut | `so`, `xo`, `cl`, `m`, `h` |

**Never** use PascalCase or camelCase for function names.

### Non-Interactive Access (`env.sh` + `tac-exec`)

The interactive guard in `tactical-console.bashrc` (`case $-`) prevents
non-interactive shells (exec environments, cron, AI agents) from loading the
profile. This is intentional — `sftp` and `rsync` must not trigger UI
side-effects. But AI agents and automation scripts need access to the ~100+
functions defined in the profile.

**`env.sh`** is a library loader that sources all 26 profile modules (01–15
plus `09b-gog`), bypassing the interactive guard and skipping `13-init.sh`
(which runs screen clear, completions, WSL loopback fixes, and EXIT traps)
and utility scripts in `tools/`. Because `09b-gog.sh` does not match the
`[0-9][0-9]-*.sh` glob it is sourced explicitly after the main loop. It is
idempotent (guarded by `__TAC_ENV_LOADED`) and sets `TAC_LIBRARY_MODE=1`
so functions can detect non-interactive sourcing if needed.

**`bin/tac-exec`** sources `env.sh` then runs `"$@"`. It is symlinked to
`~/.local/bin/tac-exec` for PATH access.

```bash
# AI agent or cron job runs:
tac-exec oc health
tac-exec model list
tac-exec so
tac-exec serve 4

# Or source directly:
source ~/ubuntu-console/env.sh && oc backup
```

Thin wrappers in `~/.local/bin/` (`so`, `xo`, `serve`, `oc-backup`, etc.)
delegate to `tac-exec` rather than re-implementing function logic. This
ensures all callers use the canonical function definitions with full error
handling, pre-flight checks, and UI formatting.

**Rule:** Never extract bash functions as standalone scripts. Always
delegate through `tac-exec`.

### Cross-Cutting State

These variables are written in one section and read by another. They are the
coupling points that must be preserved during modularisation:

| Variable | Written By | Read By | Medium |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LAST_TPS` | `burn`, `__llm_stream` (§11) | `tactical_dashboard` (§12) | `/dev/shm/last_tps` |
| `__LAST_LLM_RESPONSE` | `__llm_chat_send` (§11) | `local_chat` (§11) | Shell variable |
| `ACTIVE_LLM_FILE` | `model use` (§11) | `oc-local-llm` (§9), dashboard (§12) | `/dev/shm/active_llm` |
| Host metrics cache | `tac_hostmetrics.sh` (external) | `__get_host_metrics` (§7), dashboard (§12) | `/dev/shm/tac_hostmetrics` |
| LLM slots cache | `__get_llm_slots` (§7) | `tactical_dashboard` (§12) | `/dev/shm/tac_llm_slots` |
| OC version cache | `__get_oc_version` (§7) | `tactical_dashboard` (§12) | `/dev/shm/tac_oc_version` |
| `VSCODE_BIN` | `__resolve_vscode_bin` (§1) | aliases (§4) | Shell variable + `/dev/shm/vscode_path` |
| `_TAC_ADMIN_BADGE` | hooks (§6) | `custom_prompt_command` (§6) | Shell variable |
| `CooldownDB` | constants (§1) | maintenance (§8) | `~/.openclaw/maintenance_cooldowns.txt` |
| `__TAC_HAS_BATTERY` | constants (§1) | `__get_battery` (§7) | Shell variable |
| `__TAC_INITIALIZED` | init (§13) | init (§13) | Shell variable |
| `__TAC_BG_PIDS` | `tactical_dashboard` (§12) | EXIT trap (§13) | Shell array (reset per render) |
| `_TAC_LOADER_VERSION` | `tactical-console.bashrc` (§0) | version computation (§0) | Shell variable |
| `TACTICAL_PROFILE_VERSION` | computed: `loader_ver.sum(module_versions)` | dashboard (§12), env info (§9) | Shell export |

### Telemetry Caching Strategy

All telemetry functions follow the same pattern to avoid blocking the UI.
The shared helper `__cache_fresh <path> <ttl>` centralises the freshness
check:

```bash
__cache_fresh() {
    [[ -f "$1" ]] && (( $(date +%s) - $(stat -c %Y "$1") < $2 ))
}

function __get_METRIC() {
    local cache="$TAC_CACHE_DIR/tac_METRIC"
    # 1. Return cached data if fresh
    if __cache_fresh "$cache" TTL; then
        cat "$cache"; return
    fi
    # 2. Launch background subshell to refresh
    (
        # ... compute new value ...
        echo "$value" > "${cache}.tmp" && mv "${cache}.tmp" "$cache"
    ) &>/dev/null &
    # 3. Return stale data (or placeholder) immediately
    [[ -f "$cache" ]] && cat "$cache" || echo "Querying..."
}
```

Cache TTLs per metric:

| Metric | TTL | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host Metrics (CPU + iGPU + NVIDIA) | 10s | iGPU from `typeperf.exe` 3D engine, NVIDIA dGPU from Windows engine counters with `nvidia-smi` compute fallback |
| GPU (NVIDIA detail) | 10s | nvidia-smi is slow (~1.2s) |
| Battery | 120s | Changes slowly |
| Context Used | 30s | Scans `agents/*/sessions/sessions.json` for token usage via `jq` |
| OC Sessions | 60s | Uses `openclaw sessions --all-agents --json`; displays cache age |
| OC Version | 86400s (24h) | CLI version barely changes |
| LLM Slots | 5s | Async query to llama.cpp `/slots` endpoint |

All caches use **atomic writes** (`write .tmp` → `mv .tmp final`) to prevent
partial reads by concurrent dashboard renders.

### Port Checking

`__test_port` uses `ss -tln "sport = :PORT"` to query the kernel socket
table. This returns in ~20ms and never hangs, unlike the previous
`/dev/tcp` approach which would block indefinitely on closed ports in WSL2
(no TCP RST sent for refused connections).

### UI Engine

All box-drawing functions use `printf -v` for padding generation (zero
subshells). The `__strip_ansi` function is pure bash regex — no `sed`, no
forks — critical because it is called 20+ times per dashboard render.

Layout constants are derived from `UIWidth` (default 80):

- `__fRow` value column: `UIWidth - 20` characters
- `__hRow` description column: `UIWidth - 22` characters
- Values exceeding their column width are truncated with `...`

### Error Handling

The ERR trap logs to `~/.openclaw/bash-errors.log` with timestamps:

```text
2026-03-07 14:32:01 [EXIT 127] some_missing_command --flag
```

Exit code 1 is **filtered out** because `grep`, `test`, and `[[ ]]` return 1
for normal "not found" / "false" conditions. Only exit codes ≥ 2 are logged.

### Security Measures

1. **LLM loopback binding** — `llama-server` binds to `127.0.0.1`, not `0.0.0.0`.
2. **API key cache** — `chmod 600` on tmpfs (`/dev/shm`). Never written to disk.
3. **Commit auto guard** — `commit_auto` blocks sending git diffs to non-localhost LLM URLs and verifies `llama-server` PID is actually running before sending.
4. **oc-llm-sync.sh integrity** — SHA256 hash is verified before sourcing. Mismatches skip the source and warn. Use `oc-trust-sync` to record a new trusted hash.
5. **ERR trap** — All failed commands (exit ≥ 2) are logged with timestamps.
6. **Bridge timeout** — `pwsh.exe` calls have a 5-second `timeout` to prevent hangs.
7. **Sudo guard** — WSL loopback fix uses `sudo -n` (non-interactive only).
8. **Variable name validation** — Bridge skips vars with non-`[a-zA-Z0-9_]` characters.

## 6. Modular Architecture — Benefits

The profile was modularised in v3.0 (splitting a ~5,184-line monolith). The
pre-modularisation file was preserved as `tactical-console.bashrc.monolith`
but has since been removed from the repository (it remains in git history).

**Ordering rules:** `01-constants.sh` must load first (everything depends on
it). `13-init.sh` must load last (runs startup side-effects). All other
modules can be reordered as long as their `@depends` are satisfied.

### Benefits Realised

| Benefit | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Faster iteration** | Edit `11e-llm-model.sh` without scrolling past 500 lines of unrelated server or GPU code. |
| **Targeted testing** | `bash -n scripts/09a-oc-gateway.sh` checks only gateway functions. |
| **Selective loading** | On a server with no GPU, skip `11d-llm-gpu.sh`. On a headless box, skip `12-dashboard-help.sh`. |
| **Reduced merge conflicts** | Edits to OpenClaw and LLM code never touch the same file. |
| **Git blame clarity** | `git log scripts/09c-oc-core.sh` shows only core dispatcher changes. |
| **Easier onboarding** | A new developer reads one 200-line module instead of a 5,184-line monolith. |

### Monolith Backup

The file `tactical-console.bashrc.monolith` was the last pre-split version of
the profile. It has been removed from the working tree but remains in git
history. To restore it for reference or emergency rollback:

```bash
git show HEAD~N:tactical-console.bashrc.monolith > tactical-console.bashrc.monolith
```

(Replace `N` with the number of commits since removal, or use the commit hash
where it was last present.)

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Source order bugs | Numeric prefixes enforce deterministic ordering. `bash -n` runs on every module in CI. |
| `readonly` collisions on re-source | Already guarded with `[[ -z "${C_Reset:-}" ]]`. |
| Missing module breaks shell | The loader warns if expected module count doesn't match; each `[[ -f ]]` guards gracefully. |
| Performance regression (many `source` calls) | 26 `source` calls add < 10ms total. Measured on this hardware. |
| Utility scripts accidentally sourced | Array-based loader (not glob) — only the 26 named profile modules are sourced. |

---

---

## 10. Repository Layout

All project files live in a single Git repository at
`~/ubuntu-console/` (remote: `github.com/waynegault/ubuntu-console`).
`~/.bashrc` is a thin loader that sources `tactical-console.bashrc`, which in
turn sources the 26 numbered profile modules from `scripts/` using an
explicit array.

**~/.bashrc enforcement:** The file is read-only (mode 444) and protected by
10 unit tests that prevent pollution with functions, aliases, exports, or
extra source commands.

### Symlink Map

| System Path | Repo Path |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.bashrc` | thin loader (not in repo — sources `tactical-console.bashrc`) |
| `~/.llm/models.conf` | `llm/models.conf` (not currently in repo) |
| `~/.local/bin/tac-exec` | `bin/tac-exec` |
| `~/.local/bin/llama-watchdog.sh` | `bin/llama-watchdog.sh` |
| `~/.local/bin/tac_hostmetrics.sh` | `bin/tac_hostmetrics.sh` |
| `~/.local/bin/oc-quick-diag` | `bin/oc-quick-diag` |
| `~/.local/bin/oc-gpu-status` | `bin/oc-gpu-status` |
| `~/.local/bin/oc-model-status` | `bin/oc-model-status` |
| `~/.local/bin/oc-model-switch` | `bin/oc-model-switch` |
| `~/.local/bin/oc-wake` | `bin/oc-wake` |
| `~/.config/systemd/user/llama-watchdog.service` | `systemd/llama-watchdog.service` |
| `~/.config/systemd/user/llama-watchdog.timer` | `systemd/llama-watchdog.timer` |

### Setup on a New Machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waynegault/ubuntu-console.git ~/ubuntu-console
cd ~/ubuntu-console
./install.sh     # creates thin ~/.bashrc loader + symlinks
exec bash        # reload profile
```

### Workflow

Use `oedit` to open the profile in VS Code. After saving changes, run
`reload` to apply. All edits go in `~/ubuntu-console/scripts/*.sh`
(or `tactical-console.bashrc` for version/loader changes) — never edit
`~/.bashrc` directly.

Commit and push:

```bash
cd ~/ubuntu-console
git add -A && git commit -m "description" && git push
```
